This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The `Dimensions.get('window')` method returns the dimensions of the application window, which might not always accurately reflect the physical screen size, especially when using notched screens or devices with system bars. The `Dimensions.get('screen')` method gives the dimensions of the physical screen.  If you need the physical screen dimensions, you must use the `screen` argument; otherwise, you get the application window size, which is commonly smaller.  The issue appears when relying on `window` to perform calculations or layouts and the calculated size is incorrect due to the missing system bars' height. For example, calculating the position of components relative to the window size will result in components being cut off or positioned incorrectly.
